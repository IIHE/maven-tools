BUILD INFO:

To build this project, two profiles must be explicitly deactivated.
These are associated with the standard build pom, but we need to make
sure that they aren't executed here.  

Use the following command options:

$ mvn '-P!cfg-module-dist' '-P!cfg-module-rpm' '-P!module-test' <goal> [goal...]

To perform a release, do the following:

$ mvn '-P!cfg-module-dist' '-P!cfg-module-rpm' \
      -Darguments="-P\!cfg-module-dist -P\!cfg-module-rpm '-P!module-test'" \
      clean release:prepare

$ mvn '-P!cfg-module-dist' '-P!cfg-module-rpm' \
      -Darguments="-P\!cfg-module-dist -P\!cfg-module-rpm '-P!module-test'" \
      release:perform

The backslashes are important to avoid shell expansion of the history. 

'-P!module-test' allows to run tests in modules other than build-profile if
PERL5LIB environment variable is defined.

You cannot use --batch-mode at the moment because you need to enter
your SourceForge password as well as the GPG key password.

You will probably also need to use the -Dusername=XXX property if your
account username is not the same as on SourceForge.
