BUILD INFO:

To build this project, three profiles must be explicitly deactivated.
These are associated with the standard build pom, but we need to make
sure that they aren't executed here.  

Use the following command options:

$ mvn '-P!cfg-module-dist' '-P!cfg-module-rpm' '-P!module-test' <goal> [goal...]

To perform a release, do the following:

$ mvn '-P!cfg-module-dist' '-P!cfg-module-rpm' \
      -Darguments="-P\!cfg-module-dist -P\!cfg-module-rpm '-P!module-test'" \
      clean release:prepare

$ mvn '-P!cfg-module-dist' '-P!cfg-module-rpm' \
      -Darguments="-P\!cfg-module-dist -P\!cfg-module-rpm '-P!module-test'" \
      release:perform

The backslashes are important to avoid shell expansion of the history. 

'-P!module-test' disable unit tests in build-profile even if PERL5LIB is defined
(build-profile delivers a parent pom for other Quattor projects: unit tests
don't make sense in this context). This allows to run unit tests in other modules.

To run unit tests in build-scripts only, without building other modules, use:

$ mvn -pl build-scripts test

You cannot use --batch-mode at the moment because you need to enter
your SourceForge password as well as the GPG key password.

You will probably also need to use the -Dusername=XXX property if your
account username is not the same as on SourceForge.
