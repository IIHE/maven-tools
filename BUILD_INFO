BUILD INFO:

To build this project, two profiles must be explicitly deactivated.
These are associated with the standard build pom, but we need to make
sure that they aren't executed here.  

Use the following command options:

$ mvn '-P!cfg-module-dist' '-P!cfg-module-rpm' <goal> [goal...]

To perform a release, do the following:

$ mvn --batch-mode '-P!cfg-module-dist' '-P!cfg-module-rpm' \
      -Darguments="-P\!cfg-module-dist -P\!cfg-module-rpm" \
      clean release:prepare

$ mvn --batch-mode '-P!cfg-module-dist' '-P!cfg-module-rpm' \
      -Darguments="-P\!cfg-module-dist -P\!cfg-module-rpm" \
      clean release:perform

The backslashes are important to avoid shell expansion of the history.
