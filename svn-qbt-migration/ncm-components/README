This makefile and the 2 associated scripts will rewrite all history and ensure 
every commit can be built with the new build tools.  Whoever wants the old
buildtools should go to SF.

First you need to create an empty repository for all the components if
it doesn't exist yet (with some already migrated components) and add a
POM file (pom.xml) at its root, copying one of the pom.xml templates provided.
You may want to review the params and edit some of them, in particular
the version.

<modules>
</modules>

Then, put the makefile and the two scripts in the parent directory of
your repository.

Edit the first variables at the beginning of the makefile to reflect
your actual environment.

Then, just run

make cmp=<component-name, without ncm->

for instance, make cmp=network

If a failure occurs, you may need to remove the directory created for
the componenent inside the git repository.
