This makefile and the 2 associated scripts will rewrite all history and ensure 
every commit can be built with the new build tools.  Whoever wants the old
buildtools should go to SF.

Normally you should start by cloning repository ncm-components-core
or ncm-components-grid from GitHub. If you would like to start with 
a fresh repository for the migrated components, you need to create 
an empty repository (with git init) and add a POM file (pom.xml)
 at its root, copying one of the pom.xml templates provided.
You may want to review the params and edit some of them, in particular
the version. 

Before running the migration script, ensure that your repository is not configured to 
do automatic conversion of CRLF. In the repository, execute:

git config core.autocrlf input

Then, copy all the files in this directory in the parent directory of
your repository.

Edit the first variables at the beginning of the makefile to reflect
your actual environment.

Then, just run:

migrate_components comp1 [comp2...)

where 'comp1', 'comp2'... is the component name without the ncm- prefix.

The script will produce a migration log file for each components in the logs/
directory. In case, there is an error, look at the log file for more information.

During troubleshooting, you may want to rerun the conversion keeping the 
intermediate files to review them. In this case, use:

make cmp=<component-name>  (without ncm- prefix)

for instance, make cmp=network

When you are done, remove the unnecessary files and git branches with:

make cmp=<component-name> clean

The operation can be safely done multiple times for the same component and will
integrate new modifications made in SVN for the dompoent. To do it you need to:
- Remove the directory matching the component name (without 'ncm-' prefix)
- In the target git repository, remote the remote and the branch matching the
component name
