This makefile and the 2 associated scripts will rewrite all history and ensure 
every commit can be built with the new build tools.  Whoever wants the old
buildtools should go to SF.

Normally you should start by cloning repository ncm-components-core
or ncm-components-grid from GitHub. If you would like to start with 
a fresh repository for the migrated components, you need to create 
an empty repository (with git init) and add a POM file (pom.xml)
 at its root, copying one of the pom.xml templates provided.
You may want to review the params and edit some of them, in particular
the version. 

Then, put the makefile and the two scripts in the parent directory of
your repository.

Edit the first variables at the beginning of the makefile to reflect
your actual environment.

Then, just run

make cmp=<component-name, without ncm->

for instance, make cmp=network

If a failure occurs, you may need to remove the directory created for
the componenent inside the git repository.
